                  Australia's Healthcare system is one of the best in the world. Australians not only avail safe and quality health care but also one of the most affordable health care there is in the world. 
                  


                  
                  This is one of the main reasons why Australians enjoy one of the longest life expectancies across the globe.<strong> Australia ranks 14th amongst 195 countries for the longest life expectancies; This equates to the top 7% of the world which speakes volumes about the robust healthcare system that is established in Australia.</strong>
                    The Healthcare system is jointly run by different levels of the Australian Government: Federal, State, Territory and local.

                  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                  industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                  scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                  into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                  release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                  software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                  Why do we use it?

                  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                  looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal
                  distribution
                  of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.
                  Many
                  desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and
                  a
                  search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have
                  evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                      Since 2001, the total expenditure on health care has increased from A$91 billion to $185 which amounts to a growth rate of 4.3% per year.

                      Having said this, the expenditure for 2018 seems to be an outlier as it is the only year where per person spending has dipped by A$27 per person.

                        As can be noted from the previous graph, the expenditure has seen to rise every year. New South Wales, the most populous state, has always been the highest in expenditure related to Healthcare every year since 2008, closely followed by Victoria, the second most populous state in Australia.


                        <strong> An interesting observation is that the expenditure seems to be increasing on a yearly basis and the ranking order in relation to the amount of statewise expenditure has remained the same since 2008 and it can be noted that this pattern aligns to the population of the state.</strong>
                        This can be confirmed by the <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/national-state-and-territory-population/latest-release">table</a> accessible on the ABS website.
